Catalysts participate in the reactions, but are neither reactants nor products of the reaction they catalyze. Catalytic Converter is one type of catalysts.</p></div><div class="header S_01_04 center down">Catalytic converters are amazingly simple devices, so it is incredible to see how big an impact they have. A catalytic converter is a device causes conversion of harmful gases into mostly harmless products. Catalytic converters were first widely introduced in American production cars in 1975. In Iran, installation of Catalysts is mandatory on the manufacturing of cars and vans, from 2004.</div><div class="header S_01_05 center down">Most modern cars are equipped with three-way catalytic converters. This refers to the three regulated emissions it helps to reduce. Three-way catalysts are designed to simultaneously convert three pollutants to harmless emissions: Carbon Monoxide (CO) → Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Hydrocarbons (HC) → Water (H2O) Oxides of Nitrogen (NOX) → Nitrogen (N2)</div><div class="header S_01_06 center">Today, we are proud as the only Manufacturer of catalytic converters in Iran with annual production capacity of 12/000/000 pieces, in addition to automotive needs of our country simultaneously reducing sanctions we are negotiating on the export of our product.</div></div><div class="scroller"><canvas id="scene_01" class="scene"></canvas></div></body></html>
